# Students Performance Prediction


The idea involves creating a simple machine learning model, specifically a linear regression model, for predicting student marks based on input features such as study hours and attendance. This model is then converted into the Core ML format, which is compatible with iOS development.

To showcase and interact with the Core ML model, a Streamlit web application is built. Streamlit is a Python library that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications. The app allows users to input feature values (e.g., study hours, attendance) through sliders and instantly see the predicted student marks using the Core ML model.

This streamlined solution is designed to be developed within a 24-hour timeframe, making it a quick prototype for educational technology or machine learning applications. It includes key steps such as data preparation, model training, Core ML conversion, and web application development with Streamlit. Keep in mind that this is a simplified approach, and additional considerations and optimizations would be necessary for a fully polished and production-ready solution.
